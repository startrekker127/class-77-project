<h1> My first Visual Studio Code Project </h1>
<p id="paragraph1"> 
Visual studio is a coding platform with multiple extensions and different looks.
To download visual studio code, Simply go to this link https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
and download it then click on the setup and start coding.
</p>
<p id="paragraph2">
And now there is the console screen, The console screen is used because it
allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a coding platform or computer system.
You can easily open the console screen by right clicking on your browser screen and then
select inspect and on the inspect page on the top right you will see a console button then click
on the console button and now you have learnt how to look at the console screen.
If you want to print something on the console screen then simply make a variable with
whatever value/sentence you want to print then write console.log(variable) and put your variable name in 
the () brackets.

var b=8
var addition=a + b

console.log(addresult)
var multiplication=a * b
